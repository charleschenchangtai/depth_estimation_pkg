# Depth Estimation Using MiDaS in ROS2 with USB Camera

This project is an implementation of a basic functionality for depth estimation, designed for use in a ROS2 framework. It leverages the MiDaS algorithm from the `torchvision` library to estimate depth from images captured by a standard, inexpensive USB camera.

The primary goal of this project is to validate the MiDaS algorithm under real-world constraints using low-cost hardware. The depth estimation results are published in ROS2 and visualized in real-time, demonstrating the viability of the algorithm for use in robotics applications. This approach provides a foundation for further developments in the field of visual perception for intelligent robots.

### Future Applications:
The success of this prototype opens the door to incorporating advanced depth estimation in various robotic vision applications, including:

- Autonomous navigation
- Object detection and recognition
- Obstacle avoidance
- Scene understanding

These capabilities will enable the development of more sophisticated visual perception systems in robotics, applicable to a range of domains such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotic manipulators.
